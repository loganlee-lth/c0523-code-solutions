## Notes

All student notes should be written here.

An operator is unary if it has a single operand.
a % b is the remainder of the integer division of a by b
If the binary + is applied to strings, it merges them (if any of the operands is a string, then the other one is converted to a string)
The binary + is the only operator that supports strings in such a way. Other arithmetic operators work only with numbers and always convert their operands to numbers
