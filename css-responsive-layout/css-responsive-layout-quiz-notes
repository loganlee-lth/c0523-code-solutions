## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
the “point” at which a website's layout changes to fit different screen sizes
- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
percentage width automatically adjusts to fit the screen size; scales with size and it is not fixed like px
- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
Because CSS is cascading; rules are applied in the order they are written (following rule is applied)
