## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
Functions are used to encapsulate a block of code and reuse it multiple times (dynamic)
Functions give a name to a handful of code statements
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
Function definition consists of the function keyword, an optional name, a comma-separated list of zero or more parameters, the start of the code block, an optional return statement, and the end of the code block
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
Function call consists of the function's name and a commma-separated list of zero or more arguments surrounded by parentheses
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
Function call does not have a function code block
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
Parameters are the names listed in the function's definition. Arguments are the real values passed to the function
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
Parameters allow a function to perform tasks without knowing the specific input values ahead of time (placeholder until an argument is passed)
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
A return statement causes the function to produce a value that can be used in a program. Also, it prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run
